 The WGAW ceremony was once again held at the JW Marriott Los Angeles L.A. Live, and the WGAE ceremony was held at the Edison Ballroom in New York. Look back at  THR ‘s live blog  for tweets and observations from inside both ceremonies. 
 
 Host  Brad Garrett  opened the L.A. event with a joke about  Woody Allen , whose adopted daughter  Dylan Farrow   published an open letter  on  The New York Times  website Saturday alleging the director  sexually assaulted her  as a child. Allen was nominated  for writing  Blue Jasmine . 
 “There is a very good chance Woody Allen won’t be here tonight, so those of you guys at the kids’ table tonight, you have nothing to worry about,” Garrett said. “Hey we even put Oshkosh B’gosh in the gift bag to get him here!”
