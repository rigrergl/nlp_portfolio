That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
The goal is to fix all broken links on the web .

News Vicky the Viking Anime Adapted into Live-Action Film google_ad_section_start INFOLINKS_ON Anime based on Swedish Vicke Viking children's book by Runer Jonsson Germany's Der Spiegel magazine and The Hollywood Reporter entertainment trade newspaper have reported that Vicke Viking , the German/Japanese animated comedy adventure series that was a hit in both Europe and Japan, will be adapted into a live-action film by German director Michael Herbig.
Herbig directed four films based on his Bullyparade comedy show, and the films have been among the top grossing films in Germany.
Herbig is casting the Vicky the Viking film before shooting begins in the summer, and the Constantin Film and Rat Pack production companies are planning for a 2009 release.
The Zuiyo Eizo animation studio based its 1974-1975 Chiisana Viking Vicke series on the Vicke Viking children's book by the Swedish author Runer Jonsson .
Zuiyo Eizo would eventually become Nippon Animation , the studio that could continue the tradition of adapting Western children's books from Heidi ( Alps no Shōjo Heidi ) and Anne of Green Gables to Peter Pan ( Peter Pan no Bōken ) and Les Orphelins de Simitra ( Porphy no Nagai Tabi ) .
Chiisana Viking Vicke 's story revolves around a plucky Viking boy who gets his father out of tight situations during their voyages.
Manga creator Eiichiro Oda has said that Chiisana Viking Vicke asserted a strong influence on his One Piece pirate manga and anime.
Thank you to Daniel Zelter and Thorsten Meyer for the news tip.

This volume is the payoff: twelve pure episodes of what One Piece does best.
