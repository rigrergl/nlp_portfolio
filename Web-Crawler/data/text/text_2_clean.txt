Naruto Demon Slayer Pokémon Boruto My Hero Academia Ito-verse SHONEN JUMP Action-Adventure Family Fantasy Jump to: Manga & Books Series One Piece Join Monkey D. Luffy and his swashbuckling crew in their search for the ultimate treasure, the One Piece.
Created by Eiichiro Oda | More Less about One Piece As a child, Monkey D. Luffy dreamed of becoming King of the Pirates.
But his life changed when he accidentally gained the power to stretch like rubber—at the cost of never being able to swim again!
Years later, Luffy sets off in search of the One Piece, said to be the greatest treasure in the world... Eiichiro Oda began his manga career in 1992 at the age of 17, when his one-shot cowboy manga Wanted!
won second place in the coveted Tezuka manga awards.
Oda went on to work as an assistant to some of the biggest manga artists in the industry, including Nobuhiro Watsuki, before winning the Hop Step Award for new artists.
His pirate adventure One Piece , which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in 1997, quickly became one of the most popular manga in Japan.
