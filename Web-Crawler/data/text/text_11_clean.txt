kaette kita son goku to nakamatachi!!'
this year's 32nd issue of shueisha 's weekly shonen jump magazine has confirmed on july 7 that the jump super anime tour will animate for the first time romance dawn , eiichiro oda 's "prototype" manga that eventually evolved into his hit one piece series.
oda drew romance dawn as two separate pirate stories that ran in weekly shonen jump 's summer special issue and 41st issue of 1996. both stories featured a young pirate named monkey d. luffy as the main character, but were otherwise much different from each other and the actual one piece manga that launched in 1997. oda named one piece 's first installment "romance dawn" after these earlier manga stories.
the two romance dawn one-shot manga stories have been republished in the one piece red and wanted books.
weekly shonen jump 's 32nd issue has also revealed the name of the tour's new dragon ball short : "ossu!
kaette kita son goku to nakamatachi!!"
(yo!
son goku and his friends return!!).
it also hints that the characters will face a previously unknown and powerful enemy.
the other manga to be animated in the tour are hideaki sorachi 's gintama , tite kubo 's bleach , hiroyuki asada 's letter bee ( tegami-bachi ), yu-gi-oh!
5d's , and blue dragon .
the tour will stop at 10 japanese cities from september 21 to november 23. source: muhyojo source: ... discuss this in the forum (18 posts) | bookmark with: digg del.icio.us reddit facebook stumbleupon this article has been modified since it was originally posted; see change history google_ad_section_end   anime castle robert's anime corner store image anime kid nemo aaa anime distribution recent articles hey , answerman!

it's pure- hearted, and yet smart enough that even the most jaded fan would have a hard time disliking it.
pretty rare combination, that.

a fine example of what can be achieved by a polished presentation of standard genre fare.
school rumble- extra class dvd this collection of supplemental bits scattered across the length and breadth of the series is meant primarily for devoted fans of the tv series or manga.
they do at least occasionally generate laughs but do not offer as much fan service as advertised.
soul rescue gn 1 2 souls saved, 1 soul lost to damnation, 9998 souls left to rescue.
few are likely to find these stats especially promising, and those rolling their eyes and groaning inwardly probably have the right idea.
bleach dvd box set 2 nestled in between two of the series' obligatory training sequences, this twenty- one- episode box set is an unsullied slice of bleach at its skull- cracking, sword- fightin', shounen- action- cool best.
bride of the water god gn 1- 2 rightfully acclaimed in its home country of korea, bride of the water god was 2006's top- selling sunjeong manhwa.
alas, the series is unlikely to repeat that success in the united states, if only because it will get lost in a flood of competing manga.
but that does not, emphatically, make it any less of a must- see, and discriminating readers with a taste for fantasy- laced, shoujo romance will not be disappointed.
cowa!
gn the plot development is too purely random and the artistic approach too simplistic for cowa to be anything more than children's fare, but it's children's fare with a sweet center that never grows saccharine.
toward the terra dvd 1- 2 despite some flaws, this adaptation of a classic '70s manga about psychics and humanities'; endeavor to eventually return to an abandoned, ruined earth proves to be a balanced, well- paced, and moderately compelling production.
kamichama karin chu gn 1 although you can, theoretically, read kamichama karin chu without having read its prequel, this would not be, generally speaking, advisable.
on the other hand, fans of the franchise may be pleased to know that the new series gets right down to business without rehashing what has come before.
unfortunately, whether you care a whit about that business is another matter entirely.
bleach gn 1 collector's edition for the fan who has everything, there was probably only one thing missing in your life, and here it is at last: bleach in hardcover!
death note: another note, the los angeles bb murder cases (novel) death note: another note, the los angeles bb murder cases takes an innovative approach to the characters and the franchise that fans should find both refreshing and rewarding.
while still a niche release that will not be fully appreciated by newcomers, it is, without question, the best shounen jump - spinoff novel to hit american shelves thus far.
more reviews... random fun gunsmith cats: bulletproof!
