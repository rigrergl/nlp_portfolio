Kaette Kita Son Goku to Nakamatachi!!'
This year's 32nd issue of Shueisha 's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine has confirmed on July 7 that the Jump Super Anime Tour will animate for the first time Romance Dawn , Eiichiro Oda 's "prototype" manga that eventually evolved into his hit One Piece series.
Oda drew Romance Dawn as two separate pirate stories that ran in Weekly Shonen Jump 's Summer Special issue and 41st issue of 1996.
Both stories featured a young pirate named Monkey D. Luffy as the main character, but were otherwise much different from each other and the actual One Piece manga that launched in 1997.
Oda named One Piece 's first installment "Romance Dawn" after these earlier manga stories.
The two Romance Dawn one-shot manga stories have been republished in the One Piece Red and Wanted books.
Weekly Shonen Jump 's 32nd issue has also revealed the name of the tour's new Dragon Ball short : "Ossu!
Kaette Kita Son Goku to Nakamatachi!!"
(Yo!
Son Goku and His Friends Return!!).
It also hints that the characters will face a previously unknown and powerful enemy.
The other manga to be animated in the tour are Hideaki Sorachi 's Gintama , Tite Kubo 's Bleach , Hiroyuki Asada 's Letter Bee ( Tegami-bachi ), Yu-Gi-Oh!
5D's , and Blue Dragon .
The tour will stop at 10 Japanese cities from September 21 to November 23.
