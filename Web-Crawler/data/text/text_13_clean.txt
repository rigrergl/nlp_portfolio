By Rachel Arons September 12, 2013 AMC confirmed yesterday that it struck a deal with Sony Pictures Television for a “Breaking Bad” spinoff series centered upon Walter White’s delightfully smarmy lawyer, Saul Goodman.
The wisecracking attorney, played by the comedian Bob Odenkirk, débuted on the show’s second season, and has since helped Walter out of numerous jams with his gift for dodging the law while practicing it.
Saul has also provided many essential moments of zinger-filled comic relief—“That’s what the kids call ‘epic fail’ ”; “Rocky called: he wants his face back”—in the show’s most torturously dark moments .
The idea for the spinoff—whose working title, “Better Call Saul,” comes from Goodman’s unctuous tagline—was developed by the “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan and the writer-producer Peter Gould, who wrote the character’s first episode.
AMC, in yesterday’s press release, announced that the show will be a “one-hour prequel” focussing on Goodman’s character before he became entangled with White—a format that leaves the character’s fate on “Breaking Bad,” along with everybody else’s, still uncertain.
(The third-to-last episode of the series airs this Sunday.)
Rumors of a Goodman spinoff have been circulating since at least last year, when Gilligan said in an interview with IndieWire that he and Odenkirk had discussed the idea.
“I like the idea of a lawyer show in which the main lawyer will do anything it takes to stay out of a court of law,” he said.
This past April, Deadline Hollywood reported that the project was developing, leading to speculation about whether the crooked, goofy character will work when he’s no longer a foil to a murderous meth lord.
Goodman, meanwhile, has established a robust presence on the Internet.
On a fake business Web site that AMC created for the character—featuring a garish orange-and-yellow color scheme and a banner reading “Welcome lawbreakers!”—you can watch “As Seen on TV” commercials, an office webcam , and a series of fake testimonials and consultations demonstrating Goodman’s professional wherewithal.
(In the (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll7GSiad0ko), he offers advice on how to escape charges of illegal tiger possession.)
Odenkirk—a former “S.N.L.” writer who, with David Cross, created the nineties cult sketch-comedy show “Mr.
Show”—brings an affable charm to the character’s lawyerly sleaze.
He makes you root for Goodman even though he’s the kind of lawyer you instinctively despise when you see ads for them on the subway.
A new breed of anti-hero, perhaps?
