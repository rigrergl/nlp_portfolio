At another different place, Wyper defeats Shura with the reject dial and the Shandia split up in the forest.\n", "long_summary": "Aboard the Going Merry, Gan Fall reveals that he introduced himself to the Straw Hats as a mercenary whey they first met because blue sea dwellers aren't knowledgeable of sky combat. When the crew asks him to explain, the Knight sets up a demonstration. Sanji is given a large hammer, and he's told to try his best to break a small shell that has been placed on top of a barrel in front of him. Usopp warns Sanji to do it gently, saying that he won't forgive the cook if he damages the ship. Gan Fall tells him to do the exact opposite, which infuriates Usopp, yelling at the Knight not to say such things just because the Merry isn't his ship. With that Sanji puts his all into the strike, though to everyone's surprise, neither the barrel nor shell are affected in the least. Nami is visibly intrigued by this, while Usopp admonishes Sanji for a pathetic showing of strength. The shell slowly gives off fumes however, leading Sanji to wonder if it mysteriously absorbed the impact somehow. Gan Fall then directs Sanji to hold the open side of the shell toward the barrel, and press the top. It releases a devastating force, completely obliterating the barrel and blowing Sanji back. While the crew reels from the explosion (Usopp has jumped off the deck of the ship), Gan Fall explains that what they just witnessed was the power of the impact dial. It stores energy from impacts to be released later. He adds that people tend to fixate them to their palm by means of a glove or bandage. This causes Sanji and Usopp to reflect on their fight with Satori, and they are now able to make sense of his abilities. As Sanji comically hits the old man for not telling him about the impact, Gan Fall brings up that legends tell of even more powerful dials in the island's history. One of these is the reject dial, which has ten times the power of an impact dial. This power increase can cost the user his life however, so they have all but been retired. Nami expresses that dials were explained to them as everyday tools and not weapons, but Gan Fall counters that any tool which can benefit man, can also hurt him. For instance, he points out that a heat dial, which is used for cooking, can be equipped on a lance to become a fire lance (Shura's heat javelin is shown as an example). In the same vein, a flame dial can be placed in a bird's mouth to create a fire-breathing bird (Fuza is shown as an example). He concludes that because of this, blue sea dwellers with no knowledge of dials and artificial clouds whatsoever stand no chance against well-versed sky combatants. On that note, Sanji decides to ask Gan Fall about the \"Mantra\" ability that they also encountered against Satori. Gan Fall states that since he doesn't have the ability himself it is a bit hard to explain, but it is essentially an enhanced perception. He goes on to say that everyone's body has a \"voice\", and one can predict a person's next move by listening to it. The range of this ability can be increased with training: the Priests are able to \"hear\" everything on Upper Yard, while Enel's range extends to the country in its entirety.

He goes on to explain the various augmentations Dr. Hogback made to his body: the skin of elephant, the 300 kilogram muscle mass of a bear and a gorilla, as well as the jaws of a lion. Adding the Suke Suke fruit to the mix, he claims his body is the ultimate piece of art. Sanji interjects with a hard kick to his head, telling him that he still peeped on women, which the onlooking zombies agree to. Absalom muses to himself that Sanji's kick is quite powerful, which makes his augmentations almost meaningless. He resolves to make himself invisible again, taunting Sanji that with the ability he always wanted, and by marrying the woman he is trying to protect, there will be no greater defeat for the pirate. Sanji recalls Usopp's story that they lost complete\u00a0track of Absalom's whereabouts once he made Nami invisible too, causing him to hold Nami in his arms for protection. Absalom lands a powerful blow to Sanji's left jaw, causing him to lift Nami above his head as blood briefly spatters from his mouth. Absalom then unleashes a flurry of blows on a defenseless Sanji, taunting him for being a human sacrifice. This culminates in him stabbing Sanji through the back, forcing Sanji to put\u00a0Nami down as he coughs up more blood. Absalom further ridicules the pirate for not sticking to his word, but Sanji apologizes to Nami for putting her down, as he did not want to get his blood on her white dress. Addressing Absalom again from all fours, Sanji comments that he\u00a0no longer has any desire for his ability. Sanji says he will peep on his own, with the irony of the situation again befuddling the onlooking zombies. Sanji notices Absalom step in some of his blood, and grabs his leg. Sanji states that since Absalom is composed of different animals, he is perfect for making mince meat. Sanji removes the knife from his back and\u00a0unleashes \"Extra Hachis\", delivering several powerful kicks in rapid succession to Absalom's invisible body. Absalom is flung across the room, and his invisible body crashes hard into the walls of the cathedral. As Sanji lights another cigarette, he tells Absalom that a beast bride is enough for a beast.\u00a0\n"}, {"id": 465, "short_summary": "Usopp battles with Perona, and his arsenal proves ineffective against her ability. On the contrary, she is quite capable of causing Usopp damage, and Kumashi re-enters the fray. Usopp calls on \"Sogeking\", who helps restore his confidence and point out a critical weakness of Perona. \n", "long_summary": "As Usopp remains puzzled by Perona's ability to fly, she attempts to shake his newfound confidence by reminding him of how he was just running in fear from Kumashi. Perona asserts that her fear was simply a result of being caught in the moment, as she never imagined she would meet someone who was unaffected by her \"Negative\" Ghosts. She offers Usopp some words of encouragement, much to his annoyance. Usopp retorts that as a sniper, her ability to fly has no impact whatsoever on his ability to hit her. Usopp explains his new weapon, \"Kabuto\": It has five supportive stems that improve range and stability, in addition to a Breath Dial he obtained from Skypiea that adds enhanced speed to his projectiles. Furthermore, he also has Impact, Flash, and Flame Dials that can enhance the power of what he fires from Kabuto. After finishing his wordy description and preparing to fire a shot however, Usopp notices that Perona has vanished. She re-appears behind him, however in a gigantic form that completely terrifies Usopp. He fires \"Ageha Ryusei\" at her, but she changes back to her normal size and effortlessly dodges. Usopp follows up with \"Kamakiri Ryusei\", but she dodges this as well. Perona moves in and plunges her hands into Usopp, causing him to severely panic at the possibility of bleeding out. She points out however that he has no external injury, despite the appearance of her penetrating him. She instead states that her hands are around his heart, and she will smash it, causing Usopp to freak out all over again. This is revealed to be a bluff however, as she reveals that she doesn't have an ability like that. Usopp is still reeling, and notes that this is all bad for his heart regardless. Perona displays more of her powers; she shows that her body can pass through just about anything, which freaks Usopp out as she demonstrates by sinking into the ground leaving only her head visible. Usopp responds by firing \"Rokuren Mamushi Boshi\", but the six shots all completely phase through her body. Perona reminds Usopp that her body can go through anything, phasing through him once more as she asserts that his attacks are all useless. \n"}, {"id": 466, "short_summary": "Usopp has finally seen\u00a0through Perona's tricks, and uses a fake hammer that weighs 10 tons to beat Perona. Zoro challenges the samurai Ryuma, and their battle begins in earnest.\u00a0\n", "long_summary": "Having finally pierced the veil on Perona's tactics, Usopp takes time to review the facts: Perona is visible to the naked eye, but is capable of phasing through people and objects effortlessly. She can also fly, and change her size at will, so a person who didn't know any better would assume that she isn't made of flesh and blood. However, based on how she ran from him as he chased her, it was clear in that particular instance that she did indeed have a physical body. He thus concludes that the Perona he has been fighting is merely a ghost that was created when he initially lost sight of her. Usopp calls attention to Perona's real body sitting motionless on a bed in the chamber in front of them, and asserts that he will no longer be fooled. Perona praises Usopp for being much more intelligent than she assumed, and notes how the Sogeking mask seems to have given him confidence. She clarifies however, that rather than a \"ghost\" that is being controlled by her real body, the form Usopp sees in front of him is her actual spirit. She is capable of separating this spirit from her physical body at will. Usopp questions what would happen if she has no physical body to go back to, as he fires \"Daibakuhatsu Boshi\" at it. Perona screams out in protest, but is relieved when the projectile appears to miss. Usopp states he needs to fire another shot, but Perona doesn't give him the chance, sending a \"Toku Hollow\" at him. Usopp surmises that this is a larger version of her \"Mini Hollows\", so allowing it to detonate would instantly kill him. The ghost bites down on his upper body, and Perona uses the opportunity to return to her physical body. As she re-awakens, she confirms that she can detonate this hollow as well by snapping her fingers, using \"Kamikaze Rap\". To her surprise, the ghost completely vanishes, and it is revealed that Usopp absorbed the blast using an Impact Dial. Before she can follow up with another attack, Perona realizes that her arm has been stuck to the bed. Usopp divulges that the attack he fired at her earlier was actually \"Torimochi Boshi\", and that he didn't miss, as his plan all along was to immobilize her once she returned to her physical body. This way, he could deal with both her physical and spiritual presences at the same time. As Usopp prepares to finish her off, a Wild Zombie, The Gallant Hippo, emerges and accosts Usopp for his defeat of Kumashi. Usopp however releases the absorbed impact from the Toku Hollow, instantly defeating the Hippo. Perona is in awe of the strength Usopp displays, though Usopp himself mentally notes the pain from the recoil of the impact dial. He fires \"Kurobikashi Boshi\" at the Ghost Princess, which results in cockroaches appearing all over her body. This is revealed to have been a ploy as well, as the attack is actually \"Gokiburi Boshi\". Perona screams in horror loud enough to be heard outside the mansion, as she frantically tries to get the roaches off of her and begs for Kumashi to come save her. Usopp says that she may be afraid of roaches, but she has a lot more to fear from him, as she truly underestimated him. As he\u00a0pulls out the 10-Ton Usopp Hammer, he states that no one in the East Blue is feared more for their superhuman strength. Believing the hammer is truly 10 tons, a grief-stricken\u00a0Perona asks where Usopp got this kind of strength from, and pleads for him not to hurt her. She continues to desperately beg\u00a0to be forgiven and promises not to harm the Straw Hats, but\u00a0this falls on deaf ears as he smashes the hammer down on her head with \"Usopp Golden Pound\". The \"hammer\" is revealed to be a balloon that pops instantly upon impact, but the psychological trauma of the attack causes Perona to pass out and foam at the mouth. Usopp expresses shock\u00a0that the \"Ghost Princess\" of a haunted mansion wouldn't be able to tell a real hammer from a balloon, or plastic cockroaches from real ones, but nevertheless asserts that she had no idea who she was messing with when she tried to use negativity and lies as her weapons.\u00a0\n"}, {"id": 467, "short_summary": "Roronoa Zoro combats the samurai Ryuma using One-Sword Style and Two-Sword Style.

Hogback responds by expanding on his frustrations of being a prodigy, stating how he at point was being visited by patients from all over the world because of his skills.
